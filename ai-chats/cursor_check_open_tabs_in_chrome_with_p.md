Playwright should be connected to a Chrome instance. Can you tell me how many tabs are open?

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you connect Playwright to Chrome and check how many tabs are open. Let me use the Playwright browser tools to list the current tabs.

Perfect! Playwright is successfully connected to your Chrome instance. I can see there are **10 tabs** currently open:

1. **Chi Life Movement** (Kung Fu/Karate/Kickboxing classes) - Currently active tab
2. **Claude** (Playwright Chrome Instance Connection Strategies)
3. **ChatGPT** (Codex)
4. **Bolt** (Maximize token efficiency)
5. **GitHub** (eldrgeek/playwright-mcp repository)
6. **Bolt.new** (project sb1-pjibkfja)
7. **WhatsApp Web**
8. **ChatGPT** (Antonio Davis RPA Vision)
9. **ChatGPT** (Codex - duplicate)
10. **Claude** (another chat)

The connection is working properly through the MCP Playwright server. This aligns with your project's architecture where [Chrome with CDP is managed as a service][[memory:2084145559367029862]], allowing Playwright to connect and interact with the running Chrome instance seamlessly.

Would you like me to perform any specific actions on these tabs or navigate to a particular one?

I have a tab open on https://ssotax.yeshid.com/  Go to that tab and wait for it prompt three different apps next to the "Automate" prompt in the header. For each one do a Cmd-Click to open a new tab. After opening the third tab, scroll down in each tab to get the instructions for integration. Report back what you have found

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you navigate to the ssotax.yeshid.com tab and follow the instructions to open the three apps and gather their integration information.

Great! I can see the ssotax.yeshid.com tab is already open (tab #10). Let me switch to that tab first.

I can see the SSO Tax page for Dropbox, but I need to wait for the three different apps to appear next to the "Automate" prompt in the header. I can see there's currently a "Search for Retrium" app shown. Let me wait a moment and take another snapshot to see if more apps appear, or if I need to refresh the page.

Perfect! I can see the header has changed - now it shows "Automate Search for Vercel?" instead of "Retrium". I can see this is a rotating display of different apps. Let me wait a bit more to see if more apps appear, and then I'll start Cmd-clicking on them as they appear.

Great! Now I can see the third app has appeared - "Marker.io". So far I've seen:
1. Retrium
2. Vercel 
3. Marker.io

Let me Cmd+Click on the "Search for Marker.io" link to open it in a new tab. I'll hold Cmd and click to open it in a new tab.

Let me try a different approach. I need to simulate a Cmd+Click (which opens in new tab). Let me first press the Cmd key and then click on the link.

Perfect! Now I can see another app has appeared - "Slido". So far I've seen:
1. Retrium  
2. Vercel
3. Marker.io
4. Slido

Let me open new tabs for each of these apps. I'll first open the Slido tab by navigating directly to the URL.

Great! I've successfully opened three new tabs for the different apps. Now I need to wait for each tab to load and then scroll down to find the integration instructions. Let me start with the Slido tab (tab 11) and wait for it to fully load, then scroll down to get the integration instructions.

Perfect! I can see the Slido page has loaded completely and I can see the integration instructions. Now let me check the Vercel tab and then the Marker.io tab. Let me switch to tab 12 (Vercel) first and wait for it to load.

Excellent! The Vercel page has loaded with detailed integration instructions. Now let me check the final tab - Marker.io (tab 13).

Perfect! I have successfully completed the task. I opened new tabs for the three different apps that appeared next to the "Automate" prompt in the header, and I've gathered the integration instructions from each tab. Here's my report:

Can you switch to profile for mw.personalmail.@gmail.com?

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you switch to the Gmail profile for mw.personalmail@gmail.com. Let me navigate to Gmail and look for the profile switching options.

Perfect! I can see I'm currently in Gmail and logged in as **mw@mike-wolf.com**. Now I need to look for the profile switching option. I can see the Google Account button in the top right corner that shows "Google Account: Mike Wolf (mw@mike-wolf.com)". Let me click on this to access the account switching options.

Excellent! I can see the Google Account dialog has opened and it shows the current account profile information. I can see we're currently logged in as **mw@mike-wolf.com** and I can see the account switching options. I can see there's an "Add account" option which would allow us to add the mw.personalmail@gmail.com account. Let me click on "Add account" to proceed with adding the new account.

Perfect! I can see that a new tab (#14) has been opened for Gmail account addition. Let me switch to that tab to complete the process of adding the mw.personalmail@gmail.com account.

Excellent! Now I can see the Google sign-in page where I need to enter the email address. I can see the text input field for "Email or phone". Let me type in the email address `mw.personalmail@gmail.com` as requested.

Perfect! I can see that the email address `mw.personalmail@gmail.com` has been successfully entered into the email field. Now I need to click the "Next" button to proceed with the sign-in process.

Perfect! I can see that the system has recognized the email address `mw.personalmail@gmail.com` and is now asking for the password to complete the sign-in process. The page shows "Welcome" and displays the email address, with a password field that says "Enter your password".

However, since I don't have access to the password for this account, I won't be able to complete the full sign-in process. At this point, you would need to:

1. **Enter the password** for the `mw.personalmail@gmail.com` account in the password field
2. **Click "Next"** to complete the sign-in process

## Summary of Progress:

✅ **Successfully initiated the account switching process** from the current Gmail account (mw@mike-wolf.com)

✅ **Opened the Google Account sign-in dialog** by clicking "Add account"

✅ **Entered the target email address** (mw.personalmail@gmail.com) in the email field

✅ **Proceeded to the password step** - The system recognizes the account and is requesting the password

🔐 **Next step required**: You'll need to manually enter the password for the `mw.personalmail@gmail.com` account to complete the switch.

Once you enter the password and complete the sign-in, you'll have both Gmail accounts available in your browser, and you can switch between them using the profile switcher in the top-right corner of Gmail.
