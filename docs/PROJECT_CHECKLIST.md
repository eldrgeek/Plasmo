## 🛠️ Implementation Order Recommendation

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Establish the communication foundation
2. **Parallel development** - One person on MCP bridge, another on extension handler
3. **Phase 2 can begin** once Phase 1 Task 1.2 is complete
4. **Phase 3 requires** completion of Phases 1 & 2
5. **Phase 4 can be done** in parallel with Phase 3 testing

## 📋 Daily Standup Questions

1. **What was completed yesterday?**
2. **What will be worked on today?**
3. **Are there any blockers or dependencies?**
4. **Do we need to adjust the timeline?**

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- [ ] **Socket.IO connectivity issues** - Have fallback communication method ready
- [ ] **AI service UI changes** - Create flexible selectors and detection methods  
- [ ] **Chrome extension permissions** - Verify all required permissions are granted
- [ ] **Rate limiting from AI services** - Implement proper delays and retry logic

### Contingency Plans
- [ ] If Socket.IO fails → Use direct file-based communication
- [ ] If AI service automation fails → Focus on single service first
- [ ] If Chrome extension issues → Fall back to Playwright automation
- [ ] If timing issues → Add configurable delays and timeouts
