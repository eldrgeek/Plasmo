# ✅ FastMCP Server Setup Complete!

Your FastMCP server for Cursor IDE integration has been successfully set up in your Plasmo browser extension project.

## 📁 Files Created

- `mcp_server.py` - Main FastMCP server with 11 development tools
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (fastmcp only)
- `setup_mcp.sh` - Automated setup script
- `start_mcp.sh` - Quick start script for the server
- `MCP_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the MCP Server
```bash
./start_mcp.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
python3 mcp_server.py
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` using FastMCP's built-in HTTP server.

### 2. Configure Cursor IDE

1. Open Cursor settings (`Cmd+,` on macOS, `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for "mcp" or "Model Context Protocol"
3. Add this configuration to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cursor-dev-assistant": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Cursor IDE

### 3. Test the Integration

Open a new chat in Cursor and try:
- "What tools are available from the MCP server?"
- "Show me the structure of my Plasmo project"
- "Read the package.json file"

## 🔧 Available Tools

Your MCP server provides these 11 tools:

### File Operations
- **read_file** - Read file contents
- **write_file** - Write content to files  
- **list_files** - List directory contents with pattern matching

### Project Analysis
- **get_project_structure** - Analyze project directory structure
- **analyze_code** - Get code metrics and analysis
- **search_in_files** - Search for patterns across files

### Version Control
- **run_git_command** - Execute safe git commands (read-only)

### Database Operations
- **create_sqlite_db** - Create SQLite databases
- **query_sqlite_db** - Query SQLite databases

### System Information
- **get_system_info** - Get system and environment information
- **server_info** - Get MCP server information

## 💡 Example Prompts for Your Plasmo Project

Once configured, try these prompts in Cursor:

### Plasmo-Specific
- "Analyze the structure of my Plasmo extension project"
- "Read and explain the manifest configuration in package.json"
- "Show me all TypeScript files in the contents directory"
- "Search for 'chrome.storage' usage across all files"
- "Analyze the popup.tsx file for code metrics"

### General Development
- "What's the git status of this repository?"
- "List all JavaScript/TypeScript files recursively"
- "Search for TODO comments in the codebase"
- "Show me the project structure up to 3 levels deep"

## 🔧 Server Management

### Start Server
```bash
./start_mcp.sh
# or
python3 mcp_server.py
```

### Stop Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running

### Check if Running
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

### View Logs
Server logs appear in the terminal. For background operation:
```bash
nohup python3 mcp_server.py > mcp_server.log 2>&1 &
```

## 🛠 Customization

The server is designed to be easily customizable:

1. **Add new tools**: Edit `mcp_server.py` and add functions with `@mcp.tool()` decorator
2. **Change port**: Modify `SERVER_PORT` variable in `mcp_server.py`
3. **Add authentication**: Implement auth middleware (see FastMCP docs)

## 📚 Documentation

- See `MCP_README.md` for comprehensive documentation
- [FastMCP Documentation](https://gofastmcp.com/)
- [Plasmo Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Only read-only git commands are allowed
- File operations are limited to the project directory
- Database operations use safe SQLite queries
- All operations include proper error handling

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check if port 8000 is available: `lsof -i :8000`
- Verify Python dependencies: `pip3 list | grep fastmcp`

### Cursor doesn't see the server
- Ensure server is running before starting Cursor
- Check URL in Cursor settings matches `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Restart Cursor after configuration

### Tools not working
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify file paths are relative to project root
- Ensure proper file permissions

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your FastMCP server is ready to supercharge your Plasmo development with AI-powered tools in Cursor IDE. The server provides comprehensive file operations, code analysis, project structure insights, and safe git operations to help you build better browser extensions faster.

Happy coding! 🚀
