# ðŸš€ Unified Service Management System Plan

## ðŸ“‹ Context Instructions to Keep in Mind
- **Services are already running and auto-restart** when their files change
- **Chrome Debug Protocol** requires integer request IDs (not strings)
- **Virtual environment** is automatically managed via `.venv` and autoenv system
- **MCP server** enables real-time debugging through AI assistance
- **Plasmo extension** has background, popup, content scripts, and options pages
- **Service manager** already exists but needs enhancement for unified dashboard system
- **Tunneling** is handled as a service 
- **Testing** is handled as a service 

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
Create a unified service orchestration system where:
- âœ… One script starts everything
- âœ… Each service has its own monitoring dashboard
- âœ… Auto-reload works for all services
- âœ… Testing runs automatically on changes to any service
- âœ… Chrome and PNPM are managed as special cases
- âœ… Real-time visibility into all running services 
- âœ… Tunneling is handled as a service 
- âœ… Native event injection and detection is handled as a service 

## ðŸš€ **DASHBOARD SYSTEM NOW LIVE!**
**âœ… Master Control Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/master`
**âœ… Socket.IO Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/socketio`
**âœ… MCP Server Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`
**âœ… Plasmo Dev Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/plasmo`
**âœ… API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8000/api/services`

Start with: `python launch_dashboard.py`

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Design Specifications
Question: should each dashboard be a separate service, or should it be a 
single service that aggregates all the dashboards?

Dashboards should space efficient and use a soft color scheme. 


### 1. **Master Control Dashboard** (`http://localhost:8000`)
- **Service Status Grid**: Real-time status of all services (running/stopped/error)
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, Memory, Port usage per service
- **Logs Aggregation**: Live log streaming from all services
- **Quick Actions**: Start/Stop/Restart buttons for each service
- **Health Checks**: Automatic ping tests for HTTP services
- **Auto-refresh**: 2-second intervals with WebSocket updates

### 2. **Socket.IO Dashboard** (`http://localhost:3001/dashboard`)
- **Connection Status**: Active WebSocket connections
- **Message Flow**: Real-time message traffic visualization
- **Room Management**: Active rooms and participant counts
- **Performance Metrics**: Message throughput, latency stats
- **Connection History**: Join/leave events timeline

### 3. **MCP Server Dashboard** (`http://localhost:8001/dashboard`)
- **Tool Usage**: MCP tool invocation statistics
- **Chrome Debug Status**: CDP connection health
- **Request/Response Flow**: Real-time MCP command tracking
- **Error Monitoring**: Failed requests and stack traces
- **Performance**: Response times and concurrent connections

### 4. **Plasmo Dev Dashboard** (`http://localhost:1012/dashboard`) 
- **Build Status**: Compilation success/errors
- **Hot Reload**: File change detection and reload status
- **Extension Status**: Chrome extension load status
- **Bundle Analysis**: File sizes and dependency tree
- **Development Metrics**: Build times, file watch count

### 5. **Testing Dashboard** (`http://localhost:8082/dashboard`)
- **Test Results**: Pass/fail status with detailed reports
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage visualization
- **Parser Testing**: Individual parser test results
- **Test History**: Timeline of test runs and results
- **Performance**: Test execution times and trends

### 6. **Chrome Debug Dashboard** (`http://localhost:9222/dashboard`)
- **Tab Management**: Active tabs with screenshots
- **Console Monitoring**: Live console output from all tabs
- **Network Activity**: Request/response monitoring
- **Extension Debugging**: Extension-specific debugging info
- **CDP Command History**: Debug protocol command log
