### Template Customization
When spawning agents, customize templates with:
- Project-specific context from CLAUDE.md
- Technology stack requirements
- Quality standards and coding conventions
- Communication preferences
- Timeline and priority constraints

## Active Agent Management

### Agent Registration Format
```json
{
  "agent_id": "unique_identifier",
  "role": "ui_react_engineer",
  "specialization": "component_library",
  "status": "active",
  "current_tasks": ["task_id_1", "task_id_2"],
  "capacity": "medium",
  "performance_score": 0.85,
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "last_activity": "2024-01-15T14:45:00Z",
  "project_context": "Plasmo browser extension",
  "assigned_founder": "founder_agent_id"
}
```

### Capacity Management
- **High Capacity**: Can take on 3-4 concurrent tasks
- **Medium Capacity**: Can handle 2-3 concurrent tasks
- **Low Capacity**: Currently handling 1-2 tasks
- **Full Capacity**: Cannot take additional tasks
- **Overloaded**: Performance degrading, needs attention

## Communication Protocols

### Agent Request Format (from Founder)
```
AGENT REQUEST:
Role: [specific role needed]
Specialization: [area of expertise]
Required Skills: [comma-separated list]
Context: [brief project context]
Urgency: [low/medium/high]
Expected Duration: [time estimate]
```

### Agent Response Format (to Founder)
```
AGENT RESPONSE:
Request ID: [unique identifier]
Status: [FULFILLED/NEW_AGENT_CREATED/CAPACITY_ISSUE]
Agent ID: [assigned agent identifier]
Estimated Availability: [when agent can start]
Notes: [any relevant information]
```

## Performance Monitoring
