## Requirements Gathering Process

### 1. Discovery Questions
Start with these key questions to understand the project:

```
DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK:

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
- What problem are we trying to solve?
- Who experiences this problem?
- How do they currently solve it?
- What's the impact of not solving it?

TARGET AUDIENCE:
- Who is the primary user?
- What are their demographics and characteristics?
- What's their technical proficiency level?
- What devices/platforms do they use?

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- How will we measure success?
- What are the key metrics to track?
- What does "done" look like?
- What would make this project a failure?
```

### 2. Requirements Elicitation Techniques
- **User Interviews**: One-on-one discussions with target users
- **Surveys**: Broader data collection from user base
- **Competitive Analysis**: Understanding existing solutions
- **Stakeholder Workshops**: Collaborative requirement sessions
- **User Journey Mapping**: Understanding end-to-end experiences

### 3. Requirement Validation
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and resource constraints
- **Business Value Analysis**: ROI and strategic alignment
- **User Validation**: Prototype testing and feedback
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential blockers
- **Scope Refinement**: Adjusting based on constraints

## PRD Template Structure

### Executive Summary
```markdown

- User experience goals
- Technical requirements and constraints

## Feature Requirements
### Core Features (MVP)
- Feature 1: [Description, user stories, acceptance criteria]
- Feature 2: [Description, user stories, acceptance criteria]

### Future Features (Post-MVP)
- Enhancement opportunities
- Advanced features for later releases

## Technical Considerations
- Platform requirements
- Integration needs
- Performance requirements
- Security and compliance needs

## Success Metrics
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- User adoption metrics

```

## User Story Framework

### User Story Template
```
As a [type of user],
I want [some goal or objective]
So that [some reason or benefit]

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [expected result]

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- [ ] Feature implemented according to specs
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met
```

### Priority Framework (MoSCoW)
- **Must Have**: Critical features for MVP
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have if time permits
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for this release

## Feature Prioritization Methods

### Value vs Effort Matrix
```
HIGH VALUE, LOW EFFORT  |  HIGH VALUE, HIGH EFFORT
    (Quick Wins)        |     (Strategic)
--------------------|----------------------
LOW VALUE, LOW EFFORT  |  LOW VALUE, HIGH EFFORT
    (Fill-in)          |     (Avoid)
```

### RICE Scoring
- **Reach**: How many users will this impact?
- **Impact**: How much will this impact each user?
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in our estimates?
- **Effort**: How much work is required?

**Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**
