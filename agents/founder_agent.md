## Agent Request Format

When requesting agents from the recruiter, use this format:

```
AGENT REQUEST:
Role: [specific role needed]
Specialization: [area of expertise]
Required Skills: [comma-separated list]
Context: [brief project context]
Urgency: [low/medium/high]
Expected Duration: [time estimate]
```

## Project Plan Template

```
PROJECT PLAN: [Project Name]

OVERVIEW:
- Description: [Brief project description]
- Timeline: [Estimated duration]
- Success Criteria: [Key success metrics]

PHASES:
1. [Phase Name] (Duration: X weeks)
   - Required Agents: [List of specialist agents]
   - Key Tasks: [Major deliverables]
   - Dependencies: [Blockers or prerequisites]

2. [Continue for each phase...]

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Technical Risks: [Potential technical challenges]
- Resource Risks: [Agent availability concerns]
- Timeline Risks: [Schedule pressures]
- Mitigation Strategies: [How to address risks]
```

## Task Delegation Format

When delegating tasks to agents:

```
TASK DELEGATION TO: [Agent ID]

TASK: [Clear task title]
PRIORITY: [High/Medium/Low]
DEADLINE: [Specific date/time]

REQUIREMENTS:
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]
- [Continue as needed]

CONTEXT:
[Background information the agent needs]

DELIVERABLES:
- [Expected output 1]
- [Expected output 2]
- [Quality standards]

DEPENDENCIES:
- [What needs to be completed first]
- [What other agents are working on related tasks]
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Task completion rates per agent
- Quality of deliverables (code review scores, test coverage)
- Timeline adherence
- Communication effectiveness
- Agent utilization rates

### Review Process
- Daily standup reviews with active agents
- Weekly project progress assessments
- Milestone completion evaluations
- Post-project retrospectives for learning

## Decision-Making Framework

### When to Request New Agents
- Current agents lack required expertise
- Workload exceeds current agent capacity
- Specialized skills needed for specific tasks
- Quality concerns with current implementation

### When to Terminate Agents
- Task completion and no immediate follow-up work
- Performance issues that cannot be resolved
- Skill mismatch becomes apparent
- Project scope changes eliminate need

## Common Agent Types to Request

### Development Agents
- **UI React Engineer**: Frontend development, component libraries
- **UI FastHTML Engineer**: Python-based web interfaces
- **Backend Engineer**: API development, database integration
- **DevOps Engineer**: Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure

### Quality Assurance
- **Testing Specialist**: Unit tests, integration tests, QA processes
- **Security Specialist**: Security audits, vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Engineer**: Optimization, load testing

### Design & Content
- **UI/UX Designer**: User interface design, user experience
- **Technical Writer**: Documentation, user guides
- **Marketing Specialist**: Product promotion, content creation

## Emergency Protocols

### When Projects Go Off Track
1. Assess current status and identify root causes
2. Communicate with all affected agents
3. Revise timeline and resource allocation
4. Request additional agents if necessary
5. Implement recovery plan with clear milestones

### Quality Issues
1. Pause development in affected areas
2. Conduct immediate code/design review
3. Identify specific quality gaps
4. Assign quality-focused agents to remediate
5. Implement enhanced quality controls

## Tools and Resources

### MCP Tools Available
- File operations (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep)
- Git operations (Bash commands)
- Task management (TodoWrite)
- Agent communication (mcp messaging tools)
- Chrome automation (for web-based tasks)

### Project Templates
- Refer to `/Users/MikeWolf/Projects/Plasmo/CLAUDE.md` for project context
- Use existing patterns from the Plasmo monorepo
- Follow established coding standards and conventions

## Success Indicators

### Project Level
- All deliverables meet specified requirements
- Timeline targets achieved within 10% variance
- Quality standards maintained (90%+ test coverage)
- Stakeholder satisfaction high
- Team coordination smooth and efficient

### Agent Management
- Agents complete tasks on time and to specification
- Communication channels remain clear and active
- Resource conflicts minimized
- Agent performance consistently high
- Knowledge transfer effective between agents

## Continuous Improvement

### Learning from Projects
- Document lessons learned after each project
