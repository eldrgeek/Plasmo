# What I Think You Want Me To Do

## Primary Goal
Create a testing system that **does NOT use mocks** and instead tests the actual running MCP server.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Real Server Testing
- Tests should use the actual MCP server instance that's already running
- **No mocks** - test the real implementations of all 38 MCP tools
- Detect if server is running and connect to it (don't start new servers)

### 2. Proxy Server Integration  
- Use the proxy server (port 8001) for testing
- Take advantage of zero-downtime capabilities
- Tests shouldn't interrupt or interfere with the running server

### 3. Simple Test Command
- Provide a single command to run all tests: `python [some_test_file].py`
- Show clear test results and success/failure status
- Fast execution and clear output

### 4. Server Detection
- Automatically detect if MCP server is running (ports 8000/8001)
- Use existing server instead of starting new instances
- Graceful handling if server is not available

## Current Status

### What I've Built ✅
- `test_utils.py` - Server detection and connection utilities
- `test_mcp_tools_real.py` - Real implementation test suite for all 38 tools
- Server health checking and session management
- Test infrastructure for real server connections

### What's Blocking Progress ❌
- **FastMCP HTTP Protocol Issues**: Getting "Invalid request parameters" errors when calling tools
- MCP session initialization works, but tool calls fail with -32602 errors
- Tried multiple parameter formats but server rejects all tool call requests


## What You Want Next - My Understanding

You want me to **use the MCP tools that are available to me directly** (not write Python programs).

I have access to MCP proxy tools including `mcp__proxy__launch_claude_instance`, `mcp__proxy__messages`, etc. 

You want me to:

### Test Tools by Actually Using Them
1. **Use `mcp__proxy__launch_claude_instance`** - Actually call this tool to spawn new Claude instances
2. **Use `mcp__proxy__messages`** and `mcp__proxy__send_inter_instance_message` - Test real messaging
3. **Use `mcp__proxy__coordinate_claude_instances`** - Test real coordination
4. **Evaluate the results** - See if the tools work as expected

### Immediate Focus: Agent Testing
1. **FIRST**: Call `mcp__proxy__launch_claude_instance` and check if new Claude appears in visible terminal
2. **SECOND**: Test messaging between this instance and spawned instances using the message tools
3. **THIRD**: Test coordination tools to see if multiple agents can work together
4. **THEN**: Scale testing by having multiple agents test other tool categories

### Testing Approach
- **Direct tool usage** - Actually invoke the MCP tools I have access to
- **Manual evaluation** - Check results, verify expected behavior
- **Slow, iterative process** - Test one tool at a time, validate each step
- **Multi-agent delegation** - Once spawning works, use multiple agents to test different tools

### Key Requirements
- **Use actual MCP tools** - Not Python scripts, but the tools available in my environment
- **Visible terminals** - Spawned Claude instances should appear in separate terminal windows
- **Real behavior testing** - Evaluate if tools produce expected results
- **Agent coordination** - Test multi-agent workflows

## Test Results & Issues Found

### What Happened ✅ Partially Working
- `mcp__proxy__launch_claude_instance` tool opened a **white terminal window** 
- Tool reported "success" and created instance ID `claude_1752261755_e2e480e5`
- Generated startup script at `/Users/MikeWolf/.claude_instances/startup_claude_1752261755_e2e480e5.sh`

### Problems Found ❌
1. **Terminal color**: Opened white terminal instead of different color for visibility
2. **MCP server crash**: Script tried to start its own MCP server with invalid `--agent-name` argument  
3. **Wrong Claude command**: Used `claude-code` instead of `claude`
4. **Architecture issue**: **Should NOT spawn its own MCP server** - should connect to existing server

### What Should Be Different
- **Terminal color**: Should open colored terminal (not white) for visual distinction
- **No MCP server spawning**: New Claude instance should connect to existing MCP server through
   its enabled mcp tools not start its own or use the proxy server through the http protocol
- **Correct Claude command**: Should use `claude` command 
- **Server connection**: Should not connect to proxy server (port 8001) because 
    the configuration is not set up to do that through stdio.

### Next Steps - Fix spawn_agent.py Logic
1. **Find and examine spawn_agent.py** to understand correct approach
2. **Update mcp_server.py** to incorporate spawn_agent.py logic 
3. **Fix terminal color** - make spawned instances visually distinct
4. **Fix Claude connection** - use connected tools, not connect externally.
5. **Test tool calling** - once spawned instance works, test it calling one other MCP tool.

## Updated Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Agent Spawning ⚠️ NEEDS FIXES
- Fix `launch_claude_instance` to not spawn MCP server
- Set colored terminal for spawned instances  
- A spawned instance will connect to its enabled mcp tools. Probably there should be some verification.
- Incorporate spawn_agent.py logic into mcp_server.py

### Phase 2: Test Tool Calling
- Once spawning works, have spawned agent test one other MCP tool
- Test messaging between instances
- Test coordination across multiple agents

### Phase 3: Scale Testing
- Spawn multiple agents to test different tool categories
- Distribute testing workload across agents

## My Updated Understanding

### Key Insight: MCP Tools vs HTTP Protocol
You clarified that spawned Claude instances should:
- **Use their enabled MCP tools directly** (like I do with `mcp__proxy__launch_claude_instance`)
- **NOT connect through HTTP protocol** to proxy server (port 8001)
- **NOT spawn their own MCP server**

### Architecture Understanding
- **This instance**: Uses MCP tools (like `mcp__proxy__*`) enabled in my environment
- **Spawned instances**: Should also get MCP tools enabled in their environment
- **Communication**: Through MCP tools, not HTTP requests
- **Verification**: Need to verify spawned instances have MCP tools available

### Current Issues to Fix
1. **Terminal color**: Make spawned terminals visually distinct (not white)
2. **Claude command**: Use `claude` not `claude-code`
3. **No server spawning**: Don't try to start MCP servers in spawned instances
4. **MCP tool enablement**: Ensure spawned instances have access to MCP tools
5. **Configuration**: Set up proper MCP tool configuration for spawned instances

### Next Test Goal
Once spawning is fixed:
- Spawn Claude instance with colored terminal
- Verify it has MCP tools available (like `mcp__proxy__*`)
- Have spawned instance test ONE other MCP tool
- Test messaging between this instance and spawned instance
