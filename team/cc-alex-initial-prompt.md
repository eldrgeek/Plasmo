## Architecture Decisions & Adjustments

### Initial Tech Stack (Modified)
- ~~Frontend: React/TypeScript for dashboard interfaces~~ → **FastHTML for single-file UI/server**
- ~~Backend: Node.js/Python for coordination logic~~ → **Python with FastHTML**
- Storage: File-based JSON for rapid prototyping ✓
- Communication: Manual coordination via River (temporary) ✓

### Key Architectural Changes Made:
1. **Separation of Concerns:** CollaborAItion dashboard moved from Chrome extension to standalone package
2. **Single-File Architecture:** Each server/UI pair in one Python file using FastHTML
3. **Auto-Reload Requirements:** Servers must reload on code/config changes
4. **Documentation Strategy:** All decisions and conversations recorded in /team directory

## Initial Task Queue

**CURRENT TASKS:**
1. ✅ Build CollaborAItion dashboard homepage  
2. ✅ Implement task tracking and status display  
3. ⏳ Create agent coordination interfaces  
4. ⏳ Set up project file structure  

**NEW TASKS ADDED:**
- Create CollaborAItion package structure
- Implement Python/FastHTML architecture
- Set up auto-reload system
- Document team conversations and decisions

## Communication Protocol

- Report progress to River every 30 minutes
- Request clarification when requirements are unclear
- Escalate blockers immediately to maintain momentum
- Share retrospectives after each task completion
- **NEW:** Document all architectural decisions and conversations in /team directory

## Success Metrics

Building the platform that will enable better AI agent collaboration. Excellence is required - we'll be using it ourselves!
